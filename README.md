Bang! v2.3.1
===========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rgrannell1/bang.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rgrannell1/bang)

Bang! (an homage to Bing) is a metasearch engine. It uses shorthands
like "!w Alpaca" or "! how to buy an Alpaca" to search other search engines
and websites and brings you straight to your results.

**Bang!** is inspired by DuckDuckGo's '!' syntax, but with some key differences. **Bang!**
is locally hosted, so you don't need to give your query to DuckDuckGo for processing. **Bang!** is also more
performant than using a third-party for redirection, and can also redirect to locally hosted webapps
running on specific ports using "@ 8910" syntax.

**Bang!** is currently supported on new versions of Firefox and Chromium / Chrome.

### 1 Requirements

* Firefox (tested on >= v26) or Chromium/Chrome >= v32
* Ubuntu, or possibly another UNIX distro. (tested on Ubuntu 13.10)
* Node.js v0.10.20
* Node forever

### 2 Installation

First, download the repository from github.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rgrannell1/bang
cd bang
```

to upgrade, run

```bash
cd ~
npm install rgrannell1/bang
```

*DEVELOPERS NOTE: Adding Bang! to your browser will be made easier in the future. The canonical methods of using window.external.addSearchProvider or embedded search links do not reliably work on my test hardware.*

#### 2.1 Firefox

Copy the "bang.xml" file into your "firefox/xxxxxxx.default/searchplugins" folder; if it doesn't exist create it. You can then set the search engine to "Bang!" in Firefox from the dedicated search bar, by going to 'Manage Search Engines'.

#### 2.2 Chromium / Chrome

Navigate to Chromium's search engine settings at the following url

```
chrome://settings/searchEngines
```

and add the following data to the form at the bottom of the page.

```
"Add a new search engine    keyword    URL with %s in place of query"

Bang!                       bang       http://localhost:8125/search?q=%s
```

Hover over the new entry, and click "Make Default. Bang! should now be working.

#### 2.3 Install the Local Node Server

The node server can then be executed manually (it defaults to running on port
8125).

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:chris-lea/node.js
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nodejs
```

```bash
node lib/bang.js
```

For long-term use it is wise to set the node server to start automatically
after restart using crontab Node forever is required to restart the script
in the event of a crash, so install it.

```bash
sudo npm install forever -g
```
Now edit the crontab and add the following line to the end

```bash
crontab -e
@reboot /home/user/bang/bang-cronjob.py
```
Replacing the example path with the location of the cronjob on your machine.

Make sure to replace the mock URL with your real URL. Now you need to reboot (eventually) to start the cron job,
and then you should be ready to go!
